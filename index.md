## Rasheed Griffith 郭人庆 

I'm an independent researcher with a background in Economics, FinTech Regulation, and Philosophy. Recently my writing has been focused on Chinese geoeconomic engagement in the Caribbean and Monetary Policy in the Mekong region. 我的普通话水平足以讨论中国的反洗钱法和加密货币行业。

## Podcast 
I host a podcast called [China in the Caribbean](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/china-in-the-caribbean/id1537137302) about the growing social, economic, and political relationship between China and the Caribbean. 在不久的将来，我计划用普通话进行面试。

Two of my best episodes:
1. Prof. Evan Ellis of the US Army War College [on China's Security Engagement in the Caribbean](https://chinacaribbean.buzzsprout.com/1307554/7440328-china-s-security-engagement-in-the-caribbean)
2. Dr. Ruben Gonzalez-Vicente of Leiden University [on Chinese Loans in the Caribbean](https://chinacaribbean.buzzsprout.com/1307554/7215163-debt-and-discontent-chinese-loans-in-the-caribbean)
